## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool for the Hawaii Department of Education that facilitates the passing of state legislature.

Some of the main functions of this tool will be:

* To provide real-time tracking of legislative measures.
* Notifying the relevant people/offices when action from them must be taken.
* Automating tasks such as document creation and updating.
* Provide the ability to search measures by key parameters and keywords.
* Track changes to documents and allow for easy comparison of different versions.

This application will help to streamline the legislative process and prevent measures from accidentally being retired due to disorganization or miscommunication.
